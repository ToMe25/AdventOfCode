# Advent of Code 2021
This folder contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).  
My intention is to solve all days in C++, and those where it seems reasonable to me, and I have the time to, in bash.

Note: My Day 24 C++ solution is not windows compatible.  
Everything else in the C++ solutions, besides the `find` call in the Makefile, should work fine on Windows.
